# Image to ASCII image (WIP)

## About
This is a program that can convert a regular image into an image made with ASCII characters.
The main difference between my project and most other projects, is that it is able to detect edges, hence the objects
will be much more defined using edge characters.

## TODO
- [x] Basic functionality
- [x] Edge detection
- [ ] Add GUI
- [ ] Create Web App
